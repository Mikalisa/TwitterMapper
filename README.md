# TwitterMapper

This application allows the user to specify keywords of interest, and monitors tweets from a service that samples Twitter in real time (or replays tweets that were previously recorded). 
It also plots the location of the user the originated the tweet on a map of the world. To do this, the app makes use of an existing geographical mapping library and the Twitter API.


The application can be run using inteliJ IDEA
